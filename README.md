Software automatically reads a colour pattern image from hard-disc and returns an array representing the colour pattern.

Legoâ€™s Life of George is a game where an image is displayed on the screen for a number of seconds before being blanked. The player of the game then has to construct the shape from
Lego blocks from memory. The player photographs the finished blocks and their computer automatically compares the brick pattern to the original image. Similar problems are found
in many image processing applications, for example the colour segmentation of real world objects; colour data matrix reading. A colour data matrix has the advantage over conventional 
blank and white versions in that more information can be stored for a given pattern.
